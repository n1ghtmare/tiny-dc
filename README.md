### Tiny DC

A tiny TUI file explorer for quick navigation of directories inspired by [tere](https://github.com/mgunyho/tere) and [z](https://github.com/rupa/z). It's faster than doing `cd` + `ls` and more convenient than using a GUI file explorer if you spend your time in the terminal. It also combines the functionality of `z` to quickly jump to directories you've visited before. It's designed to be minimal and fast, with a focus on usability and performance.

Tiny DC is not a "file manager", it can be used to browse directories only. It doesn't have any manipulation features like copying, moving, or deleting files/directories.

NOTE: This was only tested on Linux, but it should work on MacOS and WSL as well. Windows support is still work in progress (PRs are welcome).
